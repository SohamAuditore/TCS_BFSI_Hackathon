# ðŸ’³ German Credit Risk Classification ðŸ’³
I made credit risk prediction on the data set taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/german-credit).

## Dataset Information

The original dataset contains 1000 entries with 20 categorial/symbolic attributes prepared by Prof. Hofmann. In this dataset, each entry represents a person who takes a credit by a bank. Each person is classified as good or bad credit risks according to the set of attributes.

## Requirements

There are some general library requirements for the Project. The general requirements are as follows.
 *	Numpy
 *	Pandas
 *	Scikit-learn
 
For Visualization
 *	Matplotlib
 *	Seaborn
 *	Plotly

The library requirements specific to some methods are:
 *  DecisionTree Model
 *	GradientBoosting Model
 *	XGBoost Model
 *	LightGBM Model
